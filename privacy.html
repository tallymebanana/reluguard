This information is collected when you submit a form or make a purchase.

<h3>Payment information</h3>

<h3>Technical information</h3>

When you submit a form, limited technical information (such as IP address and user agent)

  <li>Vercel (hosting and server logs)</li>
  <li>Resend (email delivery)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data retention</h2>
<p>
We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfil requests or purchases,
meet legal or accounting obligations, and resolve disputes.
</p>

<h2>5. Your rights (EU/EEA)</h2>
