      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: 24 January 2026</p>

      <p>
        ReluGuard (“we”, “us”, “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use personal
        information when you visit <strong>reluguard.vercel.app</strong> (the “Site”).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

      <h3>Information you provide</h3>
      <p>When you submit a form or begin a purchase journey, you may provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Organisation name (optional)</li>
        <li>Template customisation inputs you choose (e.g., risk appetite, AI tools in scope, data sensitivity focus)</li>
        <li>Any message you send via the contact form (e.g., invoice/PO requests)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment information</h3>
      <p>
        Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do not collect or store your card details.
        Stripe receives payment and billing information directly and processes it under its own privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Technical information (limited)</h3>
      <p>
        When you use the Site, limited technical information may be processed for security and abuse prevention
        (for example, IP address, timestamps, and user agent via standard server logs and form submissions).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Advertising and tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We may run ads on platforms such as <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>LinkedIn</strong> to direct people to this Site.
        These platforms may use their own cookies and tracking technologies on their services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On this Site</strong>, we do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or behavioural advertising cookies.
        We do not run Meta/LinkedIn “Insight Tags”, Google Analytics, or similar tracking scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you arrive via an ad, the link may include campaign parameters (e.g., <code>utm_source</code>, <code>utm_campaign</code>).
        If present, we may process these parameters in a limited way to understand which campaigns drive enquiries or purchases.
        We do not use them to build behavioural profiles or track you across other websites.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond to enquiries (including invoice/PO requests)</li>

        <li>Deliver the purchased template by email</li>
        <li>Provide customer support (e.g., resend delivery email if needed)</li>
        <li>Prevent misuse, spam, or fraud</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data.</strong></p>

      <h2>4. Sharing your information</h2>
      <p>We share personal information only with service providers necessary to operate the Site, such as:</p>

        <li><strong>Vercel</strong> (hosting and server logs)</li>
        <li><strong>Resend</strong> (email delivery)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may also share information where required by law or to protect our rights and prevent fraud.

        <li><strong>Contract</strong> (to deliver the product you purchase)</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (to respond to enquiries, operate the Site, and prevent abuse)</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> (where applicable for accounting/tax records)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfil purchases and enquiries, operate the Site,
        meet legal/accounting obligations, and resolve disputes.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your rights (EU/EEA)</h2>
